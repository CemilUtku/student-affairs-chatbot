Student Affairs AI Assistant
An AI-powered conversational assistant designed to automate and streamline university Student Affairs operations.
Built using Angular, FastAPI, RAG pipelines, and Phi-4, this project delivers real-time, domain-specific responses to student queries by integrating retrieval-augmented generation with LLM inference.

Project Overview:
This project aims to provide a more efficient and scalable communication channel for universities by replacing traditional human-handled student inquiries with an intelligent AI assistant.
The system answers questions related to registration, transcript requests, academic procedures, and general university operations — all while ensuring accuracy, speed, and consistency.

Our solution integrates:
-A modern Angular front-end
-A performant FastAPI backend
-A custom RAG knowledge pipeline built from university-specific documents
-Phi-4 for lightweight yet powerful LLM inference
-Real-time request/response integration between UI and model

This made the assistant fully capable of understanding, retrieving, and generating institution-specific answers.

Team Members:
This was a 4-person senior design project, collaboratively built from scratch.

I was responsible for developing the complete Angular-based front-end of the chatbot, designing the conversation interface, and implementing the full request–response workflow with FastAPI. I also handled
the integration between the UI and the RAG-powered backend, ensuring smooth communication with the Phi-4 model and stable API behavior during development.Additionally, I collected real student inquiries 
directly from the university’s Student Affairs Office to help build a domain-specific dataset, which helped improving the relevance and accuracy of the model’s responses.

This project was developed between October 2024 and May 2025.
